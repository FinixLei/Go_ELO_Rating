This is a ELO rating system for Go. 

The start point of this system is all.sh, in which you can use 2 ways to download Go games' records from "http://www.hoetom.com/matchlatest_2011.jsp". 
Then this program will filter and calculate the ELO scores for all the Go professional players. 

Also, there is one tool called Predict.pl to predict the Go game result for the 2 designated Go players.
